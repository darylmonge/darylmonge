👋 Greetings, I’m @darylmonge
I have been a software developer, architect, and engineer for longer than I care to admit.  
I love building things and creating useful and interesting applications and systems.
Outside of the software world I spend time on Cycling and Music (keyboards, synths, etc)

🌱 I’m currently learning Swift development and multiplatform Application systems for MacOS and other *OS devices
I'm also expanding my experience with container technology (a.k.a Docker) and orchestrators (such as Kubernetes)
My passion is cycling (human powered...) and I hope to support the IT interests of bicycle clubs with technical solutions and expertise.

💞️ At some point I hope I can contribute to some interesting open source projects
